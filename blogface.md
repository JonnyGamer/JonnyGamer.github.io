    Yo check it out, I'm setting up my website.
I learned how to use Markdown and some of HTML. Secret -1s await. I must make a unique emoji `:-1:` Greatness AwaitS.
Testing [here](https://jonnygamer.github.io/mazejam). Throw us -1-1-1 <sub><sup>`inline elements`</sup></sub> WOw that was cool.
Check back with us in a couple weeks, it'll be much much better.
Markdown has funny features here, but I can't seem to get a good font in html. \_\_ha\_\_ \_\_init\_\_. Where shall I put the dreaded Zero Width Character??
I might make a copy/paste button for it. Or you can `Copy this ->​<-`. Now you have a friendly Zero Width Space. Ahahahaha I have you now!,,,,<br>
    I've been tabbed,, here marks the place where I can tab things. I know you really enjoy reading things such as these.

Today we will talk about [this](https//:jonnygamer.github.io/Test). Single element tuples are of utmost importance. I simply must use them.
I will place a bounty of `5 -1 bucks` for anyone who can make a single element tuple. DOn't forget the -1 bucks. Methinks you are having a good time reading this.
If so, I ask you to answer this survey: `hhave you ever seen -1?` If you're answer is true, do not fret. -1 knows all. -1 is all. -1 is. <sub>even so.</sub>
However, we must take leave and travel hither this very instant. So long, farewell. Until we meet again when -1 comes into his own.
-1 to rule them all, -1 to find them. -1 to to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. It's here. the one. **IT's HERE** fly you fools it's here.

How magestic of us. -1 thinks so too. Today I created this website. I'm trying to make it a custom domain `jonp.io` however, some dude is using it elsewhere.
I'll really have to get support with the team. Later Today we learned many great things. Such as the qualities of greatness. Such as -1 &c. Never forget.
We never forget this. Later, you might be reading this page, and you will be very surprised. It will even surprise me! Suprise us in the end! the end is nigh.
We always remember to think about this important day. Jun 28th was a massive day. back in history, -1 even ––––1ed on that historic day.
