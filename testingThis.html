Check back with us in a couple weeks, it’ll be much much better.
Markdown has funny features here, but I can’t seem to get a good font in html. __ha__ __init__. Where shall I put the dreaded Zero Width Character??
I might make a copy/paste button for it. Or you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy this -&gt;​&lt;-</code>. Now you have a friendly Zero Width Space. Ahahahaha I have you now!,,,,<br>
    I’ve been tabbed,, here marks the place where I can tab things. I know you really enjoy reading things such as these.

I will place a bounty of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 -1 bucks</code> for anyone who can make a single element tuple. DOn’t forget the -1 bucks. Methinks you are having a good time reading this.
If so, I ask you to answer this survey: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hhave you ever seen -1?</code> If you’re answer is true, do not fret. -1 knows all. -1 is all. -1 is. <sub>even so.</sub>
However, we must take leave and travel hither this very instant. So long, farewell. Until we meet again when -1 comes into his own.
