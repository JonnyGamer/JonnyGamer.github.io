# **In Person Meetings**

### **Where will we be meeting?**
If possible, we will be meetings at Foxworthy Baptist Church. If Foxworthy Baptist Church is unavaiable, and you still feel comfortable to meet in-person, you can email me.

---
### **What is the $100 materials fee?**
If you decide to use an iPad that I provide, the $100 materials fee is a fully refundable deposit for the iPad in case it breaks during class.

• **Notice:** The $100 materials fee only applies if you choose to use one of my iPads in class. You can bypass this fee if you bring your own iPad.

• **Notice:** The $100 materials fee also only applies for **in-person** classes. If you decide to do an online class, you will need to purchase your own iPad.

---
### **Can I take the iPad home?**
The iPads I provide in class will only stay in class. You can always choose to bring in your own iPad.

---
### **Do I need to download anything on my own iPad for in person classes?**
For the in person class, you will need to download [Swift Playgrounds](https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492). This app was developed by Apple. We will be using this to code.

---
### **What curriculum will you be using?**
I have created my own Swift curriculum. The students will be using my app to learn Apple's Swift Programming Language. They will also be using the Swift Playgrounds app.

---
### **Curriculum on my own iPad?**
If you decide to bring your own iPad, I can download my curriculum onto your device.

---
### **Can I take the curriculum home?**
My curriculum is locked with a password. Every class, I will log you in to the curriculum, and it will give your student access to it for the duration of the class. If you'd like to learn or do research during the week, that would be totally awesome!

---
### **What can I do during the week?**
During the week, I may provide a special online activity. This is entirely optional.

---
### **Can I bring my Macbook?**
If you have your own Apple Laptop, and you want to bring it into class, you can do that! Later in the year, I can help you download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), the professional programming tool that allows you to publish to the Apple App Store.

# **Online Meetings**

### **What iPad will I use?**
For online meetings, you will need to use your own iPad, or purchase one.

---
### **Do I need to download anything on my own iPad?**
For the online class, you will need to download 2 separate apps.

1. [Swift Playgrounds](https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492) - This app was developed by Apple. We will be using this to code.
2. [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) - This app was developed by Apple. I will use this to invite you to a Special Beta Testing Group to use my Swift Master Class curriculum.

---
### **What is the price of these additional apps?**
These apps are both free. For TestFlight, you may need to use your Apple ID to sign in.

---
### **Will there be any updates?**
From time to time Swift Playgrounds and TestFlight may need to be updated.

# **iPad Questions**

### **What iPad can I buy?**
If you have chosen to purchase you own iPad, or aready own one, please double check that it has the following specs:
- Manufactured in March 2016 or later.
- Running iPad OS (aka iOS 13) or later.
- At least 32 GB of Available Storage.
- Cellular Data is *not* required.

---
### **Where can I buy an iPad?**

You can choose to buy new iPads, or used ones.

**New iPads:** You can buy new iPads directly from Apple. If you want to compare all the models they offer, you can [look here](https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/).

Recommendations if you're buying a new iPad:
- Choose the Space Gray color, that way it will conceal dirt.
- A memory capacity of at least 32 GB. Ideally 64 GB or more.
- Cellular Data is *not* required.
- Apple Care is a great insurance for your new iPad

**Used iPads:** You can also buy used iPads off of eBay. If you would like help doing research, you can email me. Be very carefull, though.

Recommendations if you're buying a used iPad:
- Don't get one with a cracked screen. It's difficult to replace.
- Make sure your seller has a good rating.
- You can buy it off of an eBay auction as well, however it can be unreliable, as you could get outbid, and therefor not be able to get it in time for the class.

---
### **What is a GB? (Gigabyte)**
A gigabyte is a unit of measurement. It measures how much data you can store on your iPad.

| Name | Symbol | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
1 bit | bit | 1 unit of information (0 or 1)
1 byte | byte | 8 units of information
1 kilobyte | KB | 1,000 bytes
1 megabyte | MB | 1,000,000 bytes (~ 1 photograph)
1 gigabyte | GB | 1,000,000,000 bytes

### **How do I know if my iPad was manufactured in March 2016 or later?**
1. Go to your *Settings* app
2. Click *General*
3. Click *About*
4. Look under *Model Name*

If your Model Name apears in the list below, it has been manufactured on March 2016 or later, and will be suitable for this class:
- iPad Pro 9.7-inch
- iPad (5th generation)
- iPad Pro 10.5-inch
- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation)
- iPad (6th generation)
- iPad Pro 11-inch
- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation)
- <s>iPad mini (5th generation)</s>
- iPad Air (3rd generation)
- iPad (7th generation)
- iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation)
- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (4th generation)

If your iPad Model Name appears lower on this list, that means it is more powerful. iPad mini's are crossed out as these will not be able to function properly in class.

---
### **Why March 2016?**
March 2016 was a transition to a more powerful processing chip. All of these iPads will be able to run the latest `iPad OS` and possibly many future OS updates. All of these iPads *also* have the proper tech specs to run AR apps (Augmented Reality).

---

---
