# **Implicitly Unwrapped Types! So safe.**

Even safer than `Force Unwrapping` is `Implicitely Unwrapped Types`. These are really bad (Well, they're not bad, they just shouldn't be used professionally). However, if you see someone using these, you should be able to know what they do.

Ok ok what are these..<br>
Very similar to Optionals.

```swift
var foo: Int! = 5
```

Well.. this seems sorta friendly, right?

---
## *No it is not!*
Because of this instacrash.

```swift
var foo: [Int]! = nil
foo.append(4) // CRASH!
```

whereas

```swift
var foo: [Int]? = nil
foo?.append(4) // Nothing happens, foo doesn't chang 
```

Woah.

Implicitely Unwrapped Types are like Optionals, but always forcefully unwrapped. (For those people who don't want to always use optional-safety or `!` bangs.)
